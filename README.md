This is an Arcade Game Website targeted towards anime fans! There are 3 games to select from. 

1. Memory Matching Game
A memory matching game where the player will have to match the anime name with the anime image while also memorizing their positions on the board.

2. Anime Quiz Game
A classic quiz game where the player will have to type in the name of the anime based on the information given on the screen such as when the anime aired and what the genres are.

3. Anime Wordle Game
A classic wordle game, however, the twist is that instead of the traditional 5 letter words, the 5 letter words will be of anime character names. This is a game based off of open source code which was obtained from https://github.com/vanshgulati16/Wordle-Clone.github.io. Adjustments were made to cater it towards my website design and target it towards anime fans.
