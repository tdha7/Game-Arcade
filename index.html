            <p>Test your anime knowledge by playing a traditional memory match game! However, there's a slight
                twist. Instead of matching images, you will be matching the anime name with the anime image! 
                Select from 3 different difficulties and try to complete it in time!

                minute to try and guess as much anime as you can!
